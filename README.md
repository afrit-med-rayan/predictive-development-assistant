# Predictive Development Assistant

An AI-powered coding companion that analyzes developer behavior patterns, code context, and project structure to predict what developers will code next.

## Features

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks developer patterns and adapts to individual coding styles
- **Code Context Understanding**: Analyzes project structure and semantic context
- **Predictive Suggestions**: Generates intelligent code predictions based on ML models
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally with differential privacy protection
- **IDE Integration**: Seamless integration with popular development environments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Build for development
npm run build:dev

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Architecture

The system is organized into several key modules:

- **Behavioral**: Captures and analyzes developer behavior patterns
- **Context**: Analyzes code structure and project context
- **Prediction**: Generates code predictions using ML models
- **Feedback**: Learns from user interactions to improve predictions
- **Integration**: Provides IDE integration and user interface

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing with TypeScript support. Tests are organized by module and include:

- Unit tests for interfaces and core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for latency and resource usage

## Contributing

Please read the design document and requirements before contributing. All code should follow the established patterns and include appropriate tests.
