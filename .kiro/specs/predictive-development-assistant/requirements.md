# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Predictive Development Assistant is an AI-powered coding companion that analyzes developer behavior patterns, code context, and project structure to predict what developers will code next. Unlike traditional code completion tools that focus on syntax, this system uses machine learning to understand developer intent and workflow patterns, providing proactive suggestions for entire functions, classes, and architectural decisions. The system learns from individual coding patterns and adapts its predictions to each developer's unique style and project requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to predict my next coding actions based on my behavioral patterns, so that I can code faster and maintain better consistency in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer starts typing in their IDE THEN the system SHALL analyze their current context and predict the next 3-5 likely code blocks they will write
2. WHEN the system makes predictions THEN it SHALL display confidence scores for each prediction based on historical pattern matching
3. WHEN a developer accepts a prediction THEN the system SHALL learn from this feedback and improve future predictions
4. WHEN a developer rejects a prediction THEN the system SHALL update its behavioral model to avoid similar suggestions in the future
5. IF the developer has been working for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL adapt its predictions based on fatigue patterns and suggest simpler implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to understand my project context and coding style, so that predictions are relevant to my current work and match my preferred patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a new project THEN it SHALL build a contextual model including file structure, dependencies, and architectural patterns
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL consider the current file context, function scope, and variable declarations
3. WHEN a developer has multiple projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate behavioral models for each project type
4. IF the developer switches between different programming languages THEN the system SHALL adapt its predictions to language-specific patterns
5. WHEN the system detects a new coding pattern THEN it SHALL incorporate this pattern into the developer's personal style model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time behavioral analysis that learns from my coding habits, so that the system becomes more accurate over time and adapts to my evolving skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer codes THEN the system SHALL track behavioral metrics including typing speed, pause patterns, and decision-making time
2. WHEN the system detects a behavioral pattern THEN it SHALL store this pattern with temporal context for future prediction enhancement
3. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL weight recent behavioral data more heavily than historical data
4. IF the developer's coding patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL detect this shift and adapt its model accordingly
5. WHEN the system has insufficient behavioral data THEN it SHALL use general programming patterns while building the personal model

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide intelligent code structure suggestions, so that I can maintain consistent architecture and follow best practices across my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer creates a new function THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate error handling, logging, and documentation patterns
2. WHEN the system detects incomplete code structures THEN it SHALL predict the missing components based on established patterns
3. WHEN the developer is working on similar functionality THEN the system SHALL suggest reusable components from previous implementations
4. IF the current code violates established project patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest corrections that align with project conventions
5. WHEN the system suggests architectural changes THEN it SHALL provide reasoning based on code quality metrics and best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless IDE integration with minimal performance impact, so that I can use the predictive assistant without disrupting my normal development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL consume less than 10% of available CPU resources during active prediction
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms to maintain real-time interaction
3. WHEN the IDE starts THEN the system SHALL initialize and be ready for predictions within 5 seconds
4. IF the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without crashing the IDE or losing developer work
5. WHEN the developer disables the system THEN it SHALL stop all background processing and free allocated resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want privacy-focused learning that keeps my code secure, so that I can benefit from AI assistance without compromising sensitive project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes code THEN it SHALL only analyze structural patterns and behavioral data, not store actual code content
2. WHEN building behavioral models THEN the system SHALL use differential privacy techniques to protect individual coding patterns
3. WHEN the system needs to update models THEN it SHALL perform all learning locally without sending code to external servers
4. IF the developer works on confidential projects THEN the system SHALL provide an isolated mode that prevents cross-project learning
5. WHEN the developer requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all stored behavioral patterns and models
